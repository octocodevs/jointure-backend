## Backend File Structure:

- **.github:** Auto-generated files.
- **app:** Houses the majority of the application's logic, including models, controllers, middleware, and other PHP classes.
- **bootstrap:** Responsible for bootstrapping the Laravel framework and starting the application. 
- **config:** Allows to configure aspects such as database connections, cache settings, session drivers...
- **database:** Contains all the files related to database operations including migrations, factories and seeders.
- **public:** Unused in this project as we use NextJs with React in frontend.
- **resources:** Contains assets.
- **routes:** Defines the endpoints of the application and specify which controller method should handle each endpoint. It supports both web routes and API routes.
- **storage:** Contains files generated by the application, such as log files, session files. The uploaded images are also stored in this folder.
- **tests:** Automated tests.
  

## Features:

- **User:** Login and registration functionalities.
- **Profile:** Each user has a business profile that can be modified.
- **Collaboration Proposals:** Users can create, edit, delete their proposals.
- **Collaborations:** Users can apply and participate to proposals.

## Database Diagram:

This data base diagram shows that there is a one to many relationship as single users can create an unlimited number of proposals to collaborate. The primary keys of the users, profiles, and proposals tables are their ids while the foreign key "user_id" on profiles, proposals, and collaborations connect all these tables, ensuring that the user's id is attached to everything they create, identifying them as the only ones able to edit or delete their profile and proposals.
